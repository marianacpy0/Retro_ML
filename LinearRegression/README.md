# Linear Regression

This regression consists in two files, the main with the data set. 

The data set consists in several values that gives the type of wime.

What this model does is give a prediction for the Alcohol content using some of the data set columns. 

The parameters were adjusted by running the code and obtaining the ideal parameters so it was faster to obtain the results with the lowest possible error. 

The output shows the erro and then an array of the params along "Hypotesis" and the "Expected value" and its respective values as showed below.

The program also shows a plot for the errors found (mean of every error), for this case the plot obtained was:
