# Logistic Regression with use of Frameworks

The program consists, in two files, the first one contains the data frame, the second one has the regression made with frameworks find in the libreary "Sklearn". 

In this case the data set is named "winequality-red" which gives as a prediction the quality of a wine.

The main program takes the data set to make a model capable of making predictions. This is made by fitting the model to the data and splitting the data set in train and test values. 

The program also contains a menu where you can choose what you want to see with previus loaded predicitons. 

- The fisrt option of the menu prints the parameters of the model, the bias and the score. 
- The second option gives a prediction for the whole data set. 
- The third option gives the prediction of the first row of the data set.
-  And the options 4-6 give a prediction with random rows of the data set. The option 7 is to exit the menu. 

The output shows something like this:
